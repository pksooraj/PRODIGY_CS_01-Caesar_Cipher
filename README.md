Welcome to the Caesar Cipher Python Program! This project is a simple implementation of the Caesar Cipher, a basic encryption technique used in cryptography. The program allows you to encrypt and decrypt messages by shifting the letters of the alphabet by a specified number of positions.

## Introduction

The Caesar Cipher is one of the earliest and simplest encryption techniques. It works by shifting the letters in a message by a fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 3, 'A' becomes 'D', 'B' becomes 'E', and so on. This program allows you to easily encrypt and decrypt messages using this technique.

## Features

- Encrypt messages using the Caesar Cipher technique.
- Decrypt messages that were encrypted using the Caesar Cipher.
- User-friendly interface with options to choose between encryption and decryption.
- Ability to handle both uppercase and lowercase letters, as well as non-alphabetic characters.

## Installation

To run this program, you'll need Python installed on your system. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/pksooraj/PRODIGY_CS_01-Caesar_Cipher.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd caesar-cipher
    ```

## Usage

To start the Caesar Cipher program, run the following command in your terminal:
```bash
python caesar_cipher.py
```

You'll see the following options in the program:

1. Encrypt message
2. Decrypt message
3. Exit

### Example

1. **Encrypt a message:**
   - Enter the message you want to encrypt.
   - Enter the shift value (an integer).

2. **Decrypt a message:**
   - Enter the message you want to decrypt.
   - Enter the shift value (an integer).
